# hello-world
This is my first GitHub project!

Hi there, nice to meet you (here).
My name is Flora. I'm here to learn more about coding and design my own project. I'm especially interested in coding & data science. In the end, I'd like to change my carreer into IT. 

For now, coding is just a new experience to me. I'm really excited about it. Feel free to join me on my ride!
